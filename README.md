# PyBer_Analysis
---
## Performing analysis to determine how ride data differs by city type and detailing how these findings can be used by Pyber.

### Summary of findings from Ride Data by City type:

* The greatest volume of total rides takes place in an urban setting, followed by that of suburban.  
  Rural areas tally the fewest number of total rides. 

* Urban locations accounted for the largest total share of fares and the highest number of drivers.

* Rural areas were the leading location type for average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

* The end of February saw an increase in total fares for all location types.  

* Total fares declined in rural and urban areas during April, however they rose sharply in suburban locations.

### Business Recommendations

* I would recommend allocating a portion of the Urban drviers to the Suburban region during April.  As weather gets nice in spring, urbanites are
  likely wanting to walk outside more and ride less. On the other hand, suburbanites are equally eager to get outside more, but destinations are more difficult 
  to arrive at by foot.  They are perhaps unnderserved by PyBer fleet and could use additional drivfers to serve the area.

* There appears to be a direct relationship between cost per ride and total rides.  If Pyber were to reduce fees in rural areas, we would anticiapte seeing a
  rise in overall ridership in a manner enough to see an increase overall fares.  
  
* I would recommend reducing the number of drivers in urban locations.  Currently there are nearly 50% more drivers than total rides over the observable period. 
  This appears to be a saturated drivers market.  In reducing urban driver count, PyBer could then potentially look at raising fares once the market is less saturated.
  A reduction in number of drivers would immerdiately improve PyBer average fare per driver metric.  The potential fare increase could ultimately improve the 
  average fare per ride metric.
